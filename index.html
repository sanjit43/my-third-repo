        <h2>#1 South Island, New Zealand</h2>
        <p>Author: <small>Travel News</small></p>
        <p>New Zealand's South Island brims with majestic landscapes at every turn, from dramatic mountains to fjords to
            glaciers. Here, you can admire the mountains of Fiordland National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, from
            hiking trails or a boat on Milford Sound. At night, journey to the University of Canterbury's Mount John
            Observatory to gaze at the starry skies. You can also indulge your inner daredevil in Queenstown, explore
            two of the most accessible glaciers in the world on the island's west coast or sample delicious food and
            wine in the Marlborough region.</p>

        <h2>#2 Paris</h2>
        <p>Author: <small>Travel News</small></p>
        <p>The magnetic City of Light draws visitors from around the globe who come to see iconic attractions like the
            Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe. But what travelers really fall in love with are the city's
            quaint cafes, vibrant markets, trendy shopping districts and unmistakable je ne sais quoi charm. Get lost
            wandering along Paris' cobblestone streets, or grab a croissant and relax on the banks of the Seine for
            hours. If you're up for a quick daytrip, head about 15 miles southwest of the city center to another
            must-see attraction: the Palace of Versailles.</p>

        <h2>#3 Bora Bora</h2>
        <p>Author: <small>Travel News</small></p>
        <p>What this small French Polynesian island may lack in size it makes up for in sheer tropical beauty. Here,
            you'll find picturesque beaches, lush jungles and luxurious resorts. The island's dormant volcano, Mount
            Otemanu, makes for a great photo-op or challenging hike, and the friendly Bora Bora locals can help you
            catch a glimpse of the island's best sights during an off-road excursion. To relax, head to Matira Beach for
            crystal-clear water and soft sand. Although a trip to Bora Bora is very expensive, most travelers say it's
            worth every penny.</p>
